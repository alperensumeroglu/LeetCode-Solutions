**Intuition**
To count subarrays with an odd sum efficiently, we recognize that the parity of a sum determines its contribution. We use prefix sums to count how many odd and even sums we have encountered so far.

**Approach**
1. Use a running sum to track the cumulative sum as we iterate.
2. Maintain counters for even and odd prefix sums.
3. If the current sum is odd, it forms an odd subarray when combined with a previously seen even prefix sum.
4. If the current sum is even, it forms an odd subarray when combined with a previously seen odd prefix sum.
5. Update the count accordingly and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Complexity**
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ since we traverse the array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ as we use only a few extra variables.
