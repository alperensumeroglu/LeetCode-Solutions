        Intuition:
        The robber must steal from at least `k` houses without robbing two adjacent houses.
        The goal is to minimize the maximum amount stolen from any house, ensuring an optimal selection.
        
        Instead of brute-forcing every possible combination (which is inefficient),  
        we use Binary Search on the answer:
        - We guess a capability (mid) and check if it allows robbing at least `k` houses.
        - If `mid` works, we try to lower it; otherwise, we increase it.

        Approach:
        1. Binary Search Setup:  
           - The robber's capability can range from `1` to `max(nums)`.
           - We initialize `left = 1` and `right = max(nums)`, and perform binary search.

        2. Greedy Feasibility Check:  
           - For each `mid` (potential capability), iterate through `nums`:  
             - Rob a house if its value is `â‰¤ mid`.
             - Skip the next house to satisfy the non-adjacent constraint.
             - Track the total number of houses robbed (`ways`).
           - If `ways >= k`, then `mid` is a valid capability.

        3. Binary Search Update:  
           - If at least `k` houses can be robbed with `mid`, reduce `mid` (`right = mid`).
           - Otherwise, increase `mid` (`left = mid + 1`).

        4. Final Answer:  
           - The smallest possible `mid` that allows robbing at least `k` houses is returned.

        Complexity Analysis:
        - Time Complexity: O(n log(max(nums)))  
          Binary search runs in O(log(max(nums))) iterations, and each iteration does a linear O(n) check.
        - Space Complexity: O(1)  
          We only use a few integer variables (left, right, mid, ways, i), so the space complexity is constant.
