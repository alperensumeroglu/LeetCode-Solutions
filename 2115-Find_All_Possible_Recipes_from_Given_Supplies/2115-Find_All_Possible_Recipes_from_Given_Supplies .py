        Intuition:
        Solve the problem by treating it as determining which nodes (recipes) can be fully reached in a graph
        where nodes are recipes, and edges are ingredients needed to make these recipes.

        Approach:
        1. Construct a graph representation where each ingredient points to recipes that require it.
        2. Use a queue mechanism to process each available ingredient and subsequently recipes that can be made.
        3. Use in-degree tracking to determine when a recipe has all its necessary ingredients available.
        
        Complexity:
        Time: O(V + E) where V is the number of recipes and E is the number of total ingredient-recipe relations.
        Space: O(V + E) for storing the graph and the in-degree counts.

        :param recipes: List of strings representing the names of recipes.
        :param ingredients: List of lists, each sublist contains ingredients needed for the corresponding recipe.
        :param supplies: List of strings representing initially available ingredients.
        :return: List of recipes that can be created.
