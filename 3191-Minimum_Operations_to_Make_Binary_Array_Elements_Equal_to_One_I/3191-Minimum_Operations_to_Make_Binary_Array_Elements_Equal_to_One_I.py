        Intuition:
        We need to flip groups of three consecutive elements to turn all elements into 1s.
        If it's impossible, we return -1. 

        Approach:
        - Iterate through the list.
        - Whenever we find a `0`, we flip the current and the next two elements.
        - Count the number of flips needed.
        - After processing, check if all elements are `1`, otherwise return -1.

        Complexity:
        - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the array, as we traverse it once.
        - Space Complexity: O(1), since we modify the array in place without extra space.
