**Intuition**
The problem requires sequential operations on an array followed by rearranging elements. The goal is to ensure that when two adjacent numbers are equal, we double one and nullify the other. Finally, we shift all zeros to the end.

**Approach**
1. Iterate through the array:
   - If `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, double `nums[i]` and set `nums[i + 1]` to zero.
2. Use a two-pointer approach to shift non-zero elements to the left.
3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.

**Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) â†’ We traverse the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) â†’ The operations are performed in place without additional storage.
