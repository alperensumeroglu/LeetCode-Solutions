# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly merge the two smallest elements 
to create a new element that is larger, aiming to exceed the threshold k as quickly as possible.

# Approach
1. Convert the input list `nums` into a min-heap to efficiently retrieve the smallest elements.
2. Repeatedly do the following until all elements are at least `k`:
   - Extract the two smallest elements.
   - Compute a new value using the formula: `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)`.
   - Insert the new value back into the heap.
   - Increase the operation count.
3. Return the total number of operations performed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n) 
  - Constructing the heap takes O(n).
  - Each extraction and insertion operation takes O(log n).
  - In the worst case, we perform O(n) operations.
  
- Space complexity: O(n)
  - The heap requires O(n) space to store the elements.
