class Solution:

    Intuition:
    We want to count the number of contiguous subarrays where the minimum element is at least `minK`
    and the maximum element is at most `maxK`. By tracking the most recent positions of values 
    outside the [minK, maxK] range, as well as the latest occurrences of minK and maxK themselves,
    we can efficiently compute the contribution of each new element in a single pass.

    Approach:
    1. Initialize:
       - total_count: accumulator for valid subarrays.
       - last_invalid_index: the index of the most recent element < minK or > maxK.
       - last_min_index: the index of the most recent element equal to minK.
       - last_max_index: the index of the most recent element equal to maxK.
    2. Iterate through nums with index i:
       a. If nums[i] is out of the [minK, maxK] bounds:
          update last_invalid_index = i
       b. If nums[i] == minK:
          update last_min_index = i
       c. If nums[i] == maxK:
          update last_max_index = i
       d. The number of new valid subarrays ending at i is:
          max(0, min(last_min_index, last_max_index) - last_invalid_index)
       e. Add that to total_count.
    3. Return total_count.

    Complexity:
    - Time Complexity: O(n), we make a single pass through the list.
    - Space Complexity: O(1), only a handful of integer variables are maintained.
