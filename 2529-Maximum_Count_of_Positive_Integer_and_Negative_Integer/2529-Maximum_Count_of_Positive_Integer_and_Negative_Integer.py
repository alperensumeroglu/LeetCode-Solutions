"""
Intuition:
- The goal is to find the maximum count of positive or negative integers in a sorted array.
- Since the array is sorted, negative numbers appear first, followed by zeros (if any), and then positive numbers.

Approach:
1. Traverse the array while counting negative numbers.
2. If a positive number is encountered, compute the number of remaining positive numbers.
3. Return the maximum between the negative and positive counts.

Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, but usually O(log n) if optimized with binary search.
- Space Complexity: O(1) since only a few integer variables are used.
