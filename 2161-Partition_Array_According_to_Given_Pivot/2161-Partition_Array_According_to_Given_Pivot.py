**Intuition**  
The problem requires us to reorder an array while maintaining relative order among elements smaller than, equal to, and greater than a given pivot. The best approach is to classify elements into three categories and then merge them.

**Approach**  
We iterate through the array and divide the elements into three lists:  
- One for elements smaller than the pivot  
- One for elements equal to the pivot  
- One for elements greater than the pivot  

Finally, we concatenate these lists in the correct order and return the result.

**Complexity**  
â€¢ Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, since we iterate through the list once and use list concatenation, which is also $$O(n)$$.  
â€¢ Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, as we use three additional lists to store the categorized elements.
