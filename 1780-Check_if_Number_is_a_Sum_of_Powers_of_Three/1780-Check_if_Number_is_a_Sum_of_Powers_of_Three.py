# Intuition
To determine if a number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of three, 
we can leverage its base-3 representation.

# Approach
- The problem can be reduced to checking the base-3 representation of `n`.
- If any digit in this representation is `2`, then `n` cannot be expressed 
  as a sum of distinct powers of three (since we can only use `0` or `1` for each power).
- We iterate by dividing `n` by `3` and checking the remainder.
- If we find `2` at any step, return `False`, otherwise return `True`.

# Complexity
â€¢ Time complexity: **O(logâ‚ƒ n)** since we are dividing `n` by 3 in each iteration.
â€¢ Space complexity: **O(1)** since we are using only a few variables.
