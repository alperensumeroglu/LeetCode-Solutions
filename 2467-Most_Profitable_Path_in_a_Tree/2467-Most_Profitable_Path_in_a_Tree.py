**Intuition**
Alice and Bob move through the tree, collecting amounts from nodes. The challenge is to determine the most profitable path Alice can take, considering that Bob might reach some nodes earlier and take part of the amount. 

**Approach**
1. Convert the given edges into an undirected adjacency list.
2. Find Bob's path to the root and store his arrival time at each node.
3. Use depth-first search (DFS) to track Aliceâ€™s movement while maximizing her collected amount.
4. If Bob arrives first, he takes the full amount; if they arrive at the same time, they split the amount.
5. The goal is to find the leaf node where Alice can collect the highest possible amount.

**Complexity**
â€¢ Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, as we traverse all nodes once.
â€¢ Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, due to adjacency list storage and recursion depth in DFS.
