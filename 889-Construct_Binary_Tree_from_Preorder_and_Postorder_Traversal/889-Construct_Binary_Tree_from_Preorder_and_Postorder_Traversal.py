Intuition
The problem requires reconstructing a binary tree from its preorder and postorder traversals. Since both traversals do not directly provide parent-child relationships, we need to utilize preorder for root determination and postorder for subtree boundaries.

Approach
1. We start by taking the first element of the preorder list as the root.
2. We use a mutable index to keep track of the position in the preorder list.
3. We locate the root's left child in the postorder traversal.
4. We recursively construct the left and right subtrees based on the identified boundaries.
5. The recursion continues until the entire tree is reconstructed.

Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) 
  - Each node is processed once to find its position and construct the subtree.
- Space complexity: O(n) 
  - Due to recursive calls and the storage of the tree structure.
