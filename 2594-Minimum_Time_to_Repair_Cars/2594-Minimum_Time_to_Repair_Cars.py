    Intuition:
    - Each mechanic repairs cars at a speed determined by their rank.
    - A mechanic with rank `r` needs `r * n^2` minutes to repair `n` cars.
    - The goal is to find the minimum time required for all mechanics, working in parallel, to repair `cars` cars.
    
    Approach:
    - Use binary search on the possible time range (1 to `min(ranks) * cars^2`).
    - For each midpoint, check if all cars can be repaired using a helper function.
    - The helper function iterates through mechanics and calculates the maximum number of cars each can repair in the given time.
    - If the total is enough, decrease the search space; otherwise, increase it.
    
    Complexity:
    - Let `N` be the number of mechanics and `M` be `min(ranks) * cars^2` (upper bound on time).
    - Binary search operates in O(log M) time.
    - Each iteration of binary search calls `can_repaired`, which runs in O(N).
    - Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N log M).
    - Space complexity: O(1) since only a few extra variables are used.
