**Intuition**
The problem requires finding two closest prime numbers in a given range. The simplest way to do this is by iterating through the range, identifying prime numbers, and tracking the closest pair.

**Approach**
1. Use a helper function `is_prime()` to determine if a number is prime.
2. Iterate through the range `[left, right]` and collect prime numbers.
3. If a newly found prime forms a pair with a gap of 2 or less, return it immediately (as it's the optimal pair).
4. If no such immediate pair is found, return the closest pair.
5. If less than two primes exist, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Complexity**
- Time complexity: $$O(n \sqrt{m})$$ where $$n$$ is the range size and $$m$$ is the max number checked for primality.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ for storing prime numbers.
