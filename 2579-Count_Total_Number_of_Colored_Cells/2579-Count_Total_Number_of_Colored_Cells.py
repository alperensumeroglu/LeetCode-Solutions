# Intuition
The problem follows a clear pattern of growth. At each minute, the number of new cells added 
is based on the previously colored cells, forming an expanding cross pattern.

# Approach
1. Start with one initially colored cell.
2. Every minute, four new cells are added for each existing boundary layer.
3. Using a loop from `2` to `n`, we increment the total count by `(i-1) * 4`, since the pattern
   grows symmetrically in all four directions.
4. Return the final count of colored cells.

# Complexity
â€¢ Time complexity: O(n), as we iterate linearly from 2 to n.
â€¢ Space complexity: O(1), since we use only a single integer variable.
