# Intuition
This problem requires finding the longest subsequence in a strictly increasing array that follows Fibonacci-like properties.
A Fibonacci-like sequence must have at least three elements, where each number is the sum of the previous two.

# Approach
1. Convert the array into a set for quick lookup.
2. Iterate over every pair of numbers in the array and try to form a Fibonacci-like sequence.
3. Use a while loop to extend the sequence as long as the next number exists in the set.
4. Track the maximum length found.
5. If no sequence of length 3 or more is found, return 0.

# Complexity
â€¢ Time complexity: O(n^2 log n) â€“ We iterate through all pairs (O(n^2)), and each sequence lookup is O(log n).
â€¢ Space complexity: O(n) â€“ We store the elements in a set for quick lookup.
