Intuition
When merging two strings to form the shortest common supersequence, we want to include all characters from both strings while maintaining the order of appearance. The idea is similar to finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) and then inserting missing characters to form the supersequence.

Approach
1. Use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to compute a table where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the shortest supersequence for substrings `str1[:i]` and `str2[:j]`.
2. Fill the DP table:
   - If characters at `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]` are the same, inherit from `dp[i-1][j-1]` + 1.
   - Otherwise, take the minimum of inserting from `str1` or `str2` (`dp[i-1][j] + 1` or `dp[i][j-1] + 1`).
3. Backtrack through the table to reconstruct the shortest supersequence by:
   - Adding common characters when they match.
   - Adding characters from `str1` or `str2` based on which contributes to the minimum cost.
   - Finally, adding any leftover characters.
4. Reverse the reconstructed sequence to get the correct order.

Complexity
â€¢ Time complexity: **O(m * n)** where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, as we compute a DP table of size `m x n` and backtrack through it.
â€¢ Space complexity: **O(m * n)** due to storing the DP table.
