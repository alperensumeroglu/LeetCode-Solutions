## Intuition:
The problem resembles a weighted interval scheduling challenge where each "job" (question)
has a value (points) and excludes certain subsequent jobs (brainpower skip). We must
select the optimal combination of questions to maximize total points while respecting
the exclusion constraints.

## Approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We use a dp array where each entry dp[i] represents
   the maximum points obtainable from question i to the end of the list.

2. **Reverse Processing**: We start from the last question and move backward. This allows
   us to build solutions based on already computed future states.

3. **Decision Making**: For each question, we calculate:
   - Solving: Current points + maximum points after skip period
   - Skipping: Maximum points from the next question
   Then store the better option in dp[i]

4. **Result Extraction**: After processing all questions, dp[0] contains the maximum
   points obtainable from the entire exam.

## Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n) - We process each question exactly once in reverse order
- Space Complexity: O(n) - We maintain a dp array of size n to store intermediate results

## Edge Cases Handled:
- Single question exams (returns that question's points)
- Questions requiring skips beyond exam length
- Zero-point questions
- Large skip counts that might cause index overflow
