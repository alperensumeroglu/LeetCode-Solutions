    Intuition:
    - The goal is to find substrings containing exactly k consonants and all 5 vowels at least once.
    - We use a sliding window approach to efficiently track substrings that satisfy these constraints.
    
    Approach:
    - Maintain a frequency dictionary for vowels.
    - Use a sliding window with two pointers (left, right) to expand and shrink the window.
    - Ensure exactly k consonants are present in the window.
    - Count the number of substrings when all 5 vowels appear.
    
    Complexity:
    - Time Complexity: O(N), since each character is processed at most twice.
    - Space Complexity: O(1), since we use a fixed-size dictionary for vowels.
