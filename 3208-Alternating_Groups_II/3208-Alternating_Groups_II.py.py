        """
        Intuition:
        - We need to count the number of contiguous alternating subarrays of length at least k.
        - An alternating group means that adjacent elements are different.

        Approach:
        - Maintain a counter `w` to track the length of the current alternating sequence.
        - Iterate through the colors array in a circular manner.
        - If the current color is different from the previous one, increment `w`.
        - Otherwise, reset `w` to 1.
        - If `w` reaches `k` or more, increment the result counter `ans`.
        
        Complexity:
        - Time Complexity: O(n) since we iterate through the array once.
        - Space Complexity: O(1) as we use only a few extra variables.
