# üöÄ 1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination
# ---------------------------------------------

# üí° Intuition:
# We want to find the number of *different shortest paths* from node 0 to node (n - 1).
# This is a classic graph problem where we compute the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm,
# but we also count how many different ways we can reach each node using that minimum time.

# üß≠ Approach:
# 1. Build an adjacency list to represent the graph.
# 2. Use a modified Dijkstra algorithm:
#    - Track the shortest time to each node (time_to_node).
#    - Track the number of ways to reach each node using that shortest time (ways_to_node).
# 3. For each neighbor:
#    - If we found a shorter time, update both time and way count.
#    - If it's the same shortest time, increment the way count.
# 4. Return the number of ways to reach node (n - 1), modulo 1e9+7.

# ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity:
# Time: O((N + E) * log N), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.
# Space: O(N + E), for the graph and auxiliary arrays.

class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, n, roads):
        # Initialize adjacency list for the graph
        graph = {}
        for i in range(n):
            graph[i] = []
        
        for u, v, t in roads:
            graph[u].append((v, t))
            graph[v].append((u, t))  # because roads are bidirectional

        # Initialize min-heap (priority queue): stores (travel_time, node)
        min_heap = [(0, 0)]

        # Shortest time to reach each node from source
        time_to_node = [float('inf')] * n
        time_to_node[0] = 0

        # Number of ways to reach each node with the shortest time
        ways_to_node = [0] * n
        ways_to_node[0] = 1

        MOD = int(1e9 + 7)

        while min_heap:

                    self.heappush(min_heap, (total_time, neighbor))
                
                elif total_time == time_to_node[neighbor]:
                    # Found another shortest path -> add ways
                    ways_to_node[neighbor] = (ways_to_node[neighbor] + ways_to_node[current_node]) % MOD

        return ways_to_node[n - 1] % MOD
