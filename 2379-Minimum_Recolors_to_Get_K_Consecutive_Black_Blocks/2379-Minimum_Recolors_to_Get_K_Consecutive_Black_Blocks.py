# Intuition
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of recoloring operations needed to achieve at least one occurrence of `k` consecutive black blocks. 
Since we can only change white blocks (`'W'` to `'B'`), our goal is to find the window of size `k` with the fewest white blocks, as those are the ones we need to recolor.

# Approach
We use the **Sliding Window** technique:
1. **Initialize a window of size `k`** and count the number of `'W'` blocks.
2. **Use a sliding window** to traverse through the string and dynamically update the count of white blocks by removing the leftmost character and adding the new rightmost character.
3. **Keep track of the minimum number of white blocks** found in any window, as this is the minimum number of recolors required.

# Complexity
â€¢ Time complexity: **O(n)**, since we iterate through the string only once using the sliding window technique.

â€¢ Space complexity: **O(1)**, as we only use a few integer variables for tracking counts and do not use any extra space dependent on the input size.
