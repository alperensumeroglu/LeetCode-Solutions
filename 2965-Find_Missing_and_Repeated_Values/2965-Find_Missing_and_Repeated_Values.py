# Intuition
Given an n x n grid where numbers from 1 to n^2 appear exactly once except for one repeated number and one missing number, 
we need to determine these two values efficiently.

# Approach
We use a set to track numbers already seen and a variable to accumulate the sum of unique numbers. As we iterate over the grid,
we check if a number has been seen before; if so, it's the repeated number. 
Then, we use the sum formula for the first n^2 natural numbers to compute the missing number.

# Complexity
â€¢ Time complexity: O(n^2), as we iterate through all elements in the grid.
â€¢ Space complexity: O(n^2), due to the set storing up to n^2 numbers.
