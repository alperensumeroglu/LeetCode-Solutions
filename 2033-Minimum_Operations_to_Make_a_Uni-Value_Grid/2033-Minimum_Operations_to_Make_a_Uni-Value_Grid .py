        Intuition: The problem asks to make all elements in a 2D grid equal with the fewest operations, 
        where each operation allows us to add or subtract a given integer x. To solve this problem, we 
        first check if it's possible to make all elements equal by verifying that the difference between 
        each element and the minimum value is divisible by x. Then, we use the median of the grid elements 
        as the optimal target, because it minimizes the total number of operations required.

        Approach: 
        1. Flatten the 2D grid into a 1D list of numbers.
        2. Check if the difference between each element and the minimum value is divisible by x. If not, return -1.
        3. Sort the list to find the median element.
        4. Calculate the number of operations (add/subtract x) required to make all elements equal to the median.

        Complexity:
        - Time Complexity: O(m * n * log(m * n)), where m * n is the total number of elements in the grid. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step.
        - Space Complexity: O(m * n), as we are storing the flattened grid in a 1D list.
